## DTSA-5301 Final Project

Hello! To get the NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data_Historic_.Rmd to knit in RStudio, you'll need to include the NYC_weather_2006-2020.csv in the same folder.

The easiest way to do this would be to make a fork of this repo, clone the fork locally ($ git clone `<code link from fork>`) and open the .Rmd file from that folder in your local environment. Otherwise, if you don't want to fork and clone, just download and save the .Rmd and .csv in the same folder and then launch the .Rmd from there. 

The COVID19_Data_Report.Rmd, on the other hand, will knit without any additional files.
