## DTSA-5301 Final Project

Hello! To get the NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data_Report.Rmd to knit in RStudio, you'll need to include the NYC_weather_2006-2020.csv in the same folder.

The easiest way to do this would be to clone this repo locally ($ git clone `<code link above`) and open the .Rmd file from that folder.

The COVID19-final-project.Rmd, on the other hand, will knit without any additional files.
